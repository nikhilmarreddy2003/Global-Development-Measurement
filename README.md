# Data Science Clustering Project

This repository contains two main files:
- **MODEL DEVELOPMENT -CLUSTERING.ipynb** — Notebook for model development and clustering.
- **cluster_app.py** — Streamlit deployment app for DBSCAN-based clustering visualization.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter to explore the project.
4. Run the deployment app using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run cluster_app.py

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
2. Apply and compare multiple **clustering algorithms**.  
3. Evaluate and profile clusters based on dataset features.  
4. Develop a **Streamlit-based interactive deployment** for real-time clustering and visualization.
